# azure-ai-formrec-demo

This is a quick demo to showcase a Custom Classification Model in Azure AI Form Recognizer.

The module can classify a PDF into 2 categories: Resume or Invoice.

I know that's a dumb use-case, but the demo is really what's happening behind the scenes with Azure AI Form Recognizer.

The model is not fantastic, as this is intended to be a super quick demo.
